`CronJob`: validate the schedule (and timezone) at synth so an invalid expression fails fast instead of after minutes of deploy.

The CDK layer passed `schedule`/`timezone` straight into the EventBridge `CfnSchedule` with no validation, so an invalid expression — e.g. `rate(10 seconds)` (EventBridge's minimum is 1 minute) or a malformed `cron(...)` — passed `cdk synth` and was only rejected by EventBridge minutes into provisioning. The mock already validated these, so local dev and deploy diverged.

The schedule parser and timezone check are now a shared `schedule` module used by both the mock and the CDK construct. `CronJob`'s constructor validates up front and throws `CronJobErrors.InvalidSchedule` / `CronJobErrors.InvalidTimezone` at synth, before any infrastructure is created.

The synth gate is deliberately lenient for `cron(...)` — it checks the 6-field shape and defers field-level semantics (`L`/`W`/`#`, year fields, named days) to EventBridge — so it never rejects an advanced-but-valid schedule. The local mock, which must actually simulate the schedule, still can't model those forms; it now throws the new `CronJobErrors.ScheduleNotSupported` (rather than `InvalidSchedule`) for them, so local dev doesn't call a deployable schedule "invalid". No behavior change for valid, mock-supported schedules.
