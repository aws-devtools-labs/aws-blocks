Add stable `data-testid` hooks to the auth UI components so e2e suites can target the shipped `Authenticator` instead of forking it. Covers every interactive element (field inputs, hidden ones included, and submit buttons) plus the containers worth asserting against: the root, per-action wrappers, heading, error, the signed-in marker, `AuthenticatedContent`, and `AccountMenuBar`. Presentational markup such as hint text and layout wrappers stays unhooked. The full selector contract, including the `<action>:<provider>` form federated actions produce, is documented in CUSTOMIZING-AUTH-UI.md.

The `@aws-blocks/blocks` umbrella package receives a `patch` because it re-exports these components from `@aws-blocks/auth-common/ui`. Sibling patch releases stay inside the umbrella's caret ranges, so `changeset version` never bumps it on its own (#212), and it is republished explicitly to stay in step with the components it hands to consumers.
