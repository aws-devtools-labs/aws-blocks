Reject oversized JSON-RPC request bodies at the shared parser. `parseRpcRequest` now caps the body at 10 MiB (`MAX_RPC_BODY_BYTES`, the same limit API Gateway enforces in production) and returns a `413` error named `PayloadTooLarge` before parsing or dispatch. In production API Gateway rejects an oversized body at the edge before the Lambda runs; enforcing the same limit at the parser means the local dev server rejects the same body instead of buffering it and wedging the local database (e.g. PGlite). Because both the Lambda handler and the dev server route through this one parser, the cap lives in a single place, and `decodeRpcResponse` surfaces it client-side as `ApiError.status === 413`.
