The sign-in UI now shows a signed-in user's email address instead of a generated id. When users sign in with their email or phone number (`users: { signInWith: ['email'] }`), Amazon Cognito gives each user a generated username (a UUID), and the `Authenticator` and `AccountMenuBar` showed that UUID ("Signed in as: 815424a9-…").

`AuthState.user` now has an optional `displayName`, which `Auth` sets in the signed-in state:

- a username the user chose stays as it is;
- otherwise it is the user's email address, then their phone number (each skipped if the session's ID token marks it unverified, as it does for an email the user changed with `updateUserAttributes` and hasn't confirmed yet), then `preferred_username`, then the username.

The `Authenticator` and `AccountMenuBar` show `displayName`, and fall back to `username` when it is absent. `displayName` is for display only, so keep keying data on `userId` / `userSub`. Only the signed-in caller's own state carries it, never a signed-out or mid-sign-in state. Users returned by `requireAuth()` and `getCurrentUser()` don't have it; read `user.attributes.email` on the server instead.

The `auth` template's status line now shows `displayName` directly.
