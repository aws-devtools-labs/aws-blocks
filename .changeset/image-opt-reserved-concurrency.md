fix(hosting): stop hardcoding image-optimization Lambda reserved concurrency

The image-optimization Lambda hardcoded `reservedConcurrency: 10`, which made `cdk deploy` fail on fresh AWS accounts (the default account-level unreserved-concurrency limit is also 10, so reserving all 10 drops the account below its required minimum and Lambda returns a 400). It now defaults to no reservation and exposes `compute.imageOptimization.reservedConcurrency` so operators with headroom can still cap it.
