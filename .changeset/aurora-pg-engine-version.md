Bump the Database block's Aurora PostgreSQL engine version from the retired `16.4` to `16.13`, and make the engine version configurable.

AWS retired Aurora PostgreSQL `16.4` in us-east-1, after which `CreateDBCluster` failed with `Cannot find version 16.4 for aurora-postgresql`, blocking every deployment of a `Database` block. The default now points at the latest available `16.x` minor (`16.13`) for the longest deprecation runway.

A new optional `postgresVersion` option on `DatabaseOptions` lets callers override the engine version (e.g. `postgresVersion: '16.13'`), so the next AWS retirement is a configuration change rather than a framework code fix.
