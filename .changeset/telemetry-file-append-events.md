fix(telemetry): keep every event written to `--telemetry-file` instead of only the first

The sink created the file with `O_CREAT | O_EXCL` and swallowed the resulting `EEXIST`, so a run that emitted more than one event recorded only the first. In `@aws-blocks/core` a `dev` server that retries a port bind emits `dev/FAIL` then `dev/SUCCESS`, and the success was lost. Events after the first are now appended to the same JSON array. A path that already existed when the run started is still left untouched. The container is unchanged — a JSON array, 2-space indented — so a consumer reading the first element is unaffected, but a file can now hold more than one event: anything asserting exactly one needs updating.
