fix(telemetry): honor opt-out when `--telemetry-file` is set

The flag let an opted-out run build an event, which persisted the installation ID to `~/.blocks/telemetry/installation-id` and printed the first-run notice, and in `@aws-blocks/core` also persisted a project ID into `<project>/.blocks/config.json`. Consent is now checked before the event is built, and in `@aws-blocks/create-blocks-app` again before it is emitted, so an opt-out landing mid-command is honored too. A disabled run writes no identifiers, prints no notice, writes no file and sends no HTTP. `--telemetry-file` now also ignores a whitespace-only path in the space-separated form, matching the `=` form.

Behavior change (0.x minor = breaking channel): to capture events without sending them, use `BLOCKS_TELEMETRY_ENDPOINT=http://127.0.0.1:1 <cmd> --telemetry-file=<path>` rather than combining the flag with `AWS_BLOCKS_DISABLE_TELEMETRY`. The detached send worker still runs and fails fast against port 1. That run is consented, so it still writes the installation ID and prints the notice.
