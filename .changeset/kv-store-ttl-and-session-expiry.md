Add opt-in TTL support to `KVStore` and use it to expire `AuthCognito` session records.

`KVStore` gains a `ttl` construct option that enables DynamoDB Time-to-Live on the table, plus per-write expiry via `put(key, value, { ttlSeconds })` or `{ expiresAt }`. Both default to off, so existing tables and every existing `put()` call are unaffected. Because DynamoDB deletes expired items asynchronously, `get` and `scan` also filter expired items on read in every runtime, and the local mock emulates the same expiry semantics.

`AuthCognito` now enables TTL on its sessions table and stamps each session write with `now + sessionTtlSeconds`. Session records store live Cognito refresh tokens, so without an expiry the table grew without bound and retained those credentials at rest indefinitely; abandoned sessions are now reaped automatically. Authorization is unchanged — validity is still decided by token revalidation on every request.
