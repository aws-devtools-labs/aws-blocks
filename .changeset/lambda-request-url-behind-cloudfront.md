Behind a Blocks CloudFront front door, a Lambda handler's `ctx.request.url` is now the URL the client called: the distribution's domain, or the custom domain it was called at (`https://d111.cloudfront.net/aws-blocks/api/orders`, not `https://<id>.execute-api.<region>.amazonaws.com/aws-blocks/api/orders`). Links and redirects a handler builds from it stay on the public domain, where the app's cookies are scoped. A container namespace behind the same door already reported that URL; the two compute types now agree. `getRequestBaseUrl()` is unchanged: it stays the gateway's origin and stage, for code that must reach the gateway directly.

- Applies to the `apiFrontDoor: 'cloudfront'` distribution and to `Hosting`'s CloudFront door (on either tier). A viewer-request CloudFront Function on their API behaviors to the gateway stamps the viewer's host as `x-blocks-public-host`; each door registers its hosts under the backend's `BLOCKS_PUBLIC_HOSTS` config.
- A handler takes the stamped host only when it is one of the backend's front-door hosts (for a wildcard alias such as `*.example.com`, a subdomain at any depth, not the apex); any other value is ignored.
- Requests sent to the `execute-api` URL directly, and requests through `Hosting`'s other doors (ALB, API Gateway, stacked, bring-your-own), keep reporting the gateway's host.
- The sandbox dev server's loopback `X-Forwarded-Host` still takes precedence, so redirect-based sign-in in a sandbox keeps working through the CloudFront URL. In both the Lambda handler and the container, it now contributes only its host: a query, fragment or userinfo in it no longer reaches `ctx.request.url`, and a request path starting `//` or `/\` can't change the URL's host.
- A container namespace the gateway proxies to behind a Blocks CloudFront door (on the `apigateway` tier, or when CloudFront can't reach its VPC) also reports the public URL now, instead of the gateway's.
- `AuthOIDC`'s same-origin relay allowance follows: at `authorize-params`, a `relayTo` on the host the client called behind a Blocks CloudFront door counts as same-origin, where the gateway's `execute-api` host did before. When the IdP calls back, the relay re-check accepts a relay to any host the backend serves over HTTPS (each CloudFront door's hosts and the gateway's), so a sign-in that started on one of a door's hosts, or on the `execute-api` URL, still finishes when the callback arrives on another.
- Each CloudFront door adds one CloudFront Function to the account.
