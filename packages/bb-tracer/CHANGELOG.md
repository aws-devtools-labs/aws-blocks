# @aws-blocks/bb-tracer

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- d7312f9: Make observability **compute-driven** so it composes correctly once an app has more than one compute. Logging, tracing, and the dashboard now key off compute state rather than off the Logger / Tracer / Dashboard blocks poking a single implicit compute.
  
  **Logging is always on; retention is a compute-level setting.** Every compute captures stdout to its own log group unconditionally — there is no "enable logging" step. The retention of that group is set per compute via a new `logRetention` prop on `LambdaCompute` (`@aws-blocks/bb-lambda-compute`), falling back to `defaults.logRetention`. Log **level** is purely per-instance runtime behavior: set it via a `Logger`'s `level` option (default `'info'`). There is no app-wide log-level default and no `LOG_LEVEL` env var.
  
  **Tracing is presence-gated.** Creating any `Tracer` in the app now enables X-Ray on **every** compute (X-Ray provisions real, costed infrastructure, so it stays off until the app opts in by constructing a Tracer). This replaces the previous model where a Tracer turned on tracing for one implicit compute. `@aws-blocks/core/cdk` adds `registerTracer()` (records Tracer presence) and `finalizeTracing()` (enables tracing on all computes at finalize); `create()` runs it before finalizing dashboards. `Compute.enableTracing()` is now idempotent.
  
  **The dashboard is organized by compute, with display toggles.** `DashboardOptions` gains `logs?: boolean` (default `true`) and `traces?: boolean` (default `true`) — app-wide display toggles applied uniformly to every compute section. `logs:false` hides the (always-captured) logs section; `traces:false` hides traces even when tracing is enabled.
  
  The dashboard covers **every** compute in the app (resolved at finalize, so construction order never matters). Each compute renders a health section always, a logs section (unless `logs:false`), and a traces section only when tracing is enabled on it (unless `traces:false`). Metrics remain app-scoped and are passed explicitly. No `computes` selector is exposed yet — it would leak the internal `Compute` type before customers can construct a compute; it arrives with the multi-compute surface.
  
  **⚠️ Behavior / API changes:**
  
  - **`Logger` no longer reconfigures log retention.** The CDK `Logger` is now a no-op placeholder (logging is always on and retention moved to the compute). The `retention` option was removed from `LoggingOptions`; set `logRetention` on the compute instead.
  - **A `Tracer` now enables X-Ray on all computes, not one.** Any Tracer in the app turns on tracing fleet-wide.
  - **`Logger` no longer reads the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable.** Log level is set solely via the per-`Logger` `level` option (default `'info'`); the previously supported `LOG_LEVEL` env-var override has been removed, and Blocks stamps no app-wide log-level config. `BlocksDefaults` has no `logLevel` field.
  - **Removed the deprecated `LoggerBBRef` / `TracerBBRef` dashboard types.** They were no longer consumed — the dashboard reads compute state directly. Loggers and Tracers were never passed to the Dashboard in this model.

## 0.1.5

### Patch Changes

- 0491157: `Metrics`, `Tracer`, and `DistributedDatabase` now report `bbName`/`bbVersion` to `Scope`, so they appear in telemetry like every other Building Block.

  All three were listed in the umbrella's `aws-blocks.vendorize` map, so `scripts/generate-bb-names.mjs` had already generated them into `OFFICIAL_BB_NAMES` — but none passed `bbMeta` to `super()`, and `Scope` only records a block in its registry when `bbName` is set. Their entries in that set were therefore inert: `Scope.getRegisteredBlocks()` could never name them, so `product.buildingBlocks` under-reported them. Each package now carries the standard `prebuild` (`generate-version.mjs Metrics` / `Tracer` / `DistributedDatabase`), which generates the `BB_NAME`/`BB_VERSION` its constructor passes through — the same wiring the other blocks use.

  `bb-tracer` and `bb-distributed-data` ship distinct mock implementations (their default entry does not re-export the AWS class), so both `index.aws.ts` and `index.mock.ts` carry the change; `bb-metrics`'s mock re-exports the AWS class, so its single runtime change covers both conditions. CDK entry points are deliberately left alone — telemetry is reported by the runtime class, not the synth-time construct.

  This is a follow-up to #298 (`AuthBasic`/`Logger`), completing telemetry parity for every vendorized block whose runtime class extends `Scope`. `@aws-blocks/blocks` takes a `patch` because it re-exports all three; sibling releases stay inside its caret range, so `changeset version` would not bump it on its own. `@aws-blocks/core` needs no bump — all three names were already present in the generated `OFFICIAL_BB_NAMES`, so that file is byte-identical.

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- ba3bf7b: docs: add per-package DESIGN.md documents

  Adds a `DESIGN.md` to each building-block package describing its architecture, API surface, mock implementation, and key design decisions.

  - Each document is cross-checked against the current source so identifiers, environment variables, error names, and described behavior match the implementation.
  - Each `DESIGN.md` is listed in its package's `files` array so it ships on npm alongside `README.md`.
  - For consistency, `bb-auth-cognito`'s document lives at the package root like every other package.
  - Bumps the umbrella `@aws-blocks/blocks` package so its bundled `docs/` — assembled from these block READMEs at build time — republishes with a fresh version. Its packed content changes whenever the READMEs change, but the version was previously left untouched, which tripped the publish integrity guard.
