# @aws-blocks/bb-realtime

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 4a830a6: feat: route event-block resources to their resolved compute
  
  AsyncJob, CronJob, and Realtime now attach their compute-bound resources to a
  compute resolved at synth rather than the stack's shared handler:
  
  - AsyncJob attaches its SQS event source to the resolved compute's function;
  - CronJob points its EventBridge Scheduler target at the resolved compute's function;
  - Realtime binds its shared WebSocket API integrations to the stack's **default**
    compute (its routes are a stack-level singleton) and grants `postToConnection`
    to the shared execution role, so `publish()` works from any compute.
  
  Each block requires a Lambda compute today and fails at synth with a typed
  `UnsupportedCompute` error (assertable via `isBlocksError`) on any other type.
  The check uses a duplicate-copy-safe brand (`LambdaCompute.isLambdaCompute`,
  backed by a `Symbol.for` marker) instead of `instanceof`, so it does not misfire
  when two copies of `bb-lambda-compute` resolve in one dependency tree.
  
  On the default single-Lambda setup the resolved/default compute is the stack's
  default, whose function is the shared handler — so this is non-breaking with no
  change to synthesized infrastructure. AsyncJob also grants SQS send to the shared
  execution role rather than the handler directly.
  
  New public surface (hence `minor`):
  
  - `@aws-blocks/core` exports `blocksError(name, message)` (the producer half of
    the `isBlocksError` contract) and `sanitizeConfigKey(id)` from `./bb-utils`
    (the single env-var-key sanitizer both config writers and runtime readers use).
  - `@aws-blocks/bb-lambda-compute` adds a `./cdk` subpath exposing the CDK-typed
    `LambdaCompute` and its `LambdaCompute.isLambdaCompute` guard.
  - `bb-async-job` / `bb-cron-job` / `bb-realtime` add an `UnsupportedCompute`
    error member.
  
  `@aws-blocks/bb-agent` builds AsyncJob and Realtime internally, so its CDK test
  moves onto the `BlocksStack.create` harness instead of a handler-only stub.
  Test-only change — no runtime behavior change to the Agent.

### Patch Changes

- c45eb92: Extend stack-wide `BlocksDefaults` (introduced in the Infrastructure Options work) with three additive fields, and adopt them across the Blocks-managed infrastructure. Each field is read independently via `option ?? scope.defaults.field` — a per-block option always wins, and no field is derived from another.
  
  `@aws-blocks/core/cdk` now adds to `BlocksDefaults` (and both `BlocksPresets`):
  
  - `logRetention: RetentionDays` — how long Blocks-managed CloudWatch log groups keep events. Preset sandbox `ONE_WEEK`, production `ONE_YEAR`.
  - `throttling: { rateLimit, burstLimit }` — request-rate limits applied to every Blocks API Gateway stage. Preset sandbox `200 / 400`, production `1000 / 2000`.
  - `accessLogging: boolean` — structured JSON access logs on every Blocks API Gateway stage. **Off by default in both presets** (opt-in), because enabling it mutates the account/region-level API Gateway CloudWatch role singleton.
  
  Also newly exported from `@aws-blocks/core/cdk`: the `BlocksThrottling` type and `ensureApiGatewayAccount()` (provisions the account-level API Gateway CloudWatch Logs role once per stack). `Scope` gains a `handlerLogGroup` getter for the shared handler log group.
  
  **Log retention** — Blocks-managed log groups now follow `defaults.logRetention` instead of AWS's infinite default: the shared handler Lambda (now owned by `BlocksStack`/`BlocksBackend` as `scope.handlerLogGroup`), the `bb-distributed-table` GSI-manager Lambdas, the `bb-distributed-data` DSQL migration Lambda, the `bb-data` Aurora migration Lambda, and the `bb-app-setting` secret-init Lambda. `bb-logger` reconfigures the shared handler group's retention — **only when an explicit per-Logger `retention` is set** (a bare `Logger` no longer writes it back, so it can't clobber another Logger's value) — rather than creating its own `/aws/lambda/<fn>` group. (Note: the framework `custom-resources.Provider` Lambdas these BBs wrap still use AWS's default retention — the L2 `Provider` exposes no log-group/retention override.)
  
  **Throttling** — applied to the core REST API stage and the `bb-realtime` WebSocket stage. On a WebSocket stage the throttle unit is messages/second across the connection.
  
  **Access logging** — when enabled, each stage writes structured JSON access logs to a dedicated CloudWatch log group (retention = `defaults.logRetention`, removal policy = `defaults.removalPolicy` so production **RETAIN**s the audit trail on teardown). The account-level API Gateway CloudWatch Logs role is provisioned once per stack and shared across stages.
  
  **⚠️ Behavior changes on upgrade:**
  - **Throttling now caps the core REST API and WebSocket stages.** Before this change these stages had no stage-level throttle (they ran at the API Gateway account default, ~10k rps). After upgrade, sandbox is capped at 200 rps / 400 burst and production at 1000 rps / 2000 burst. Apps serving above the production ceiling will see `429`s — raise it with a per-stack `throttling` override (`defaults: { ...BlocksPresets.production, throttling: { rateLimit, burstLimit } }`).
  - **The shared handler Lambda log group changes.** The handler previously logged to Lambda's auto-created `/aws/lambda/<fn>` group (infinite retention); it now logs to a framework-owned group with the default retention. On upgrade the old auto group is left orphaned in CloudWatch (unmanaged, still infinite) — delete it manually if you want its history/cost gone. Likewise a `bb-logger`-created retention group from a prior version is replaced.
  - **Access logging** is **opt-in (off in both presets)**. When enabled it requires the account-level API Gateway CloudWatch Logs role — an account/region-level singleton, so enabling it is safe for **one Blocks stack per region** (see `ensureApiGatewayAccount()` for the multi-stack teardown caveat). It defaults off (rather than on for production) so an upgrade never mutates that account-wide singleton without an explicit opt-in.
  - **`BlocksDefaults` gains three required fields** (`logRetention`, `throttling`, `accessLogging`). Apps that spread a `BlocksPresets` preset (the documented path) are unaffected; code that hand-rolls a literal `BlocksDefaults` object will need to add the new fields to compile.
  
  `bb-dashboard` now points its log widgets at the framework-owned handler log
  group (`scope.handlerLogGroup.logGroupName`) instead of reconstructing
  `/aws/lambda/<fn>` — the handler now writes to a dedicated group with a
  CDK-generated name, so the old convention would leave the "Recent Errors" /
  "Log Volume" widgets querying an empty group.
  
  Hosting adoption of these defaults (SSR REST API + compute log groups) ships in a separate change.

### Patch Changes

- 5491cae: Harden subscription token validation. Connect tokens now use a `$connect` suffix that prevents them from being reused as channel subscription tokens via prefix matching. Channel tokens remain valid as connect tokens. Backward-compatible during rollout.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- ba3bf7b: docs: add per-package DESIGN.md documents

  Adds a `DESIGN.md` to each building-block package describing its architecture, API surface, mock implementation, and key design decisions.

  - Each document is cross-checked against the current source so identifiers, environment variables, error names, and described behavior match the implementation.
  - Each `DESIGN.md` is listed in its package's `files` array so it ships on npm alongside `README.md`.
  - For consistency, `bb-auth-cognito`'s document lives at the package root like every other package.
  - Bumps the umbrella `@aws-blocks/blocks` package so its bundled `docs/` — assembled from these block READMEs at build time — republishes with a fresh version. Its packed content changes whenever the READMEs change, but the version was previously left untouched, which tripped the publish integrity guard.
