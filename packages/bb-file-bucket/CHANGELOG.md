## 0.1.5

### Patch Changes

- 309a236: refactor(bb): attach IAM grants to the shared execution role
  
  Data and auth blocks now grant permissions to the shared Blocks execution role
  (`this.executionRole`) instead of the handler function directly. Grants land on
  the same role the handler assumes, so the effective runtime permissions are
  identical — this decouples IAM wiring from the concrete Lambda function ahead of
  the multi-compute model.
  
  For `bb-distributed-data`, the DSQL endpoint and region now flow through the
  config registry (loaded into `process.env` at cold start, like every other
  block) rather than being set as direct handler environment variables, and the
  migration Lambda maps the shared execution role's ARN.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- bd59e60: Harden the local dev file server against stored XSS and token forgery. Downloads are now served with `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` and `Content-Disposition: attachment`, so an uploaded `text/html`/SVG payload can no longer execute inline in the app's origin. The HMAC secret used to sign presigned-URL tokens is now a per-process random value instead of a hardcoded, source-visible literal, so tokens can no longer be forged offline. Both the token-minting mock and the validating dev file server share the same in-process value, so local presigned-URL round-trips are unaffected.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- ba3bf7b: docs: add per-package DESIGN.md documents

  Adds a `DESIGN.md` to each building-block package describing its architecture, API surface, mock implementation, and key design decisions.

  - Each document is cross-checked against the current source so identifiers, environment variables, error names, and described behavior match the implementation.
  - Each `DESIGN.md` is listed in its package's `files` array so it ships on npm alongside `README.md`.
  - For consistency, `bb-auth-cognito`'s document lives at the package root like every other package.
  - Bumps the umbrella `@aws-blocks/blocks` package so its bundled `docs/` — assembled from these block READMEs at build time — republishes with a fresh version. Its packed content changes whenever the READMEs change, but the version was previously left untouched, which tripped the publish integrity guard.
