## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 8ca3692: feat: shared, framework-neutral `ui-theme` design-token layer
  
  Introduce a design-token layer for the Blocks UI so the shared Auth
  components and the starter templates share one consistent, polished look
  with no new runtime framework dependency.
  
  - `@aws-blocks/auth-common` ships a new theme module: CSS custom
    properties (`--bb-*` for color, spacing, radius, typography, elevation)
    on `:root`, a light and dark palette driven by `prefers-color-scheme`
    with a `data-bb-theme` override hook, and base `.bb-*` component
    classes. The palette declares `color-scheme` so UA-drawn widgets
    (checkboxes, `<select>`, scrollbars, `::placeholder`, autofill) follow
    the active palette, and `.bb-button` has a `:disabled` state. A new
    idempotent, SSR-safe `injectTheme()` adds the stylesheet to the document
    once. The shared `Authenticator`, `AccountMenuBar`, and
    `AuthenticatedContent` now render against these token classes instead
    of inline styles and inject the theme themselves, so the themed look
    travels with the component into any host (lit-html, vanilla, React,
    Next.js) with zero wiring. Every `data-testid` is preserved.
  - `@aws-blocks/blocks` re-exports `injectTheme`, `THEME_CSS`, and
    `THEME_STYLE_ID` from `@aws-blocks/blocks/ui`, and adds a lean
    `@aws-blocks/blocks/theme` subpath that re-exports ONLY the token layer
    (no `Authenticator`/WebAuthn surface) for non-auth hosts. `@aws-blocks/auth-common`
    is marked `sideEffects: false` so a bundler can drop the unused UI
    surface; `@aws-blocks/blocks` is not, because as an aggregator that
    re-exports side-effecting building blocks it is not side-effect-free.
  - `@aws-blocks/create-blocks-app` templates (`default`, `react`,
    `nextjs`, `demo`, `auth-cognito`) adopt the tokens for their own page
    chrome and todo UI, so the whole page is themed and dark-mode-aware;
    the `bare` template stays deliberately minimal. The static templates
    inline the first-paint palette and the `nextjs` template server-renders
    the token `<style>` so a dark-mode user never sees a white flash before
    the bundle runs. A `--bb-color-success` token keeps success messages
    from reading as accent blue.
  
  Focus states use a real `outline` ring (preserved under forced-colors /
  Windows high-contrast mode) rather than an `outline: none` + `box-shadow`
  ring, which such modes drop.
  
  Additive and non-breaking.

## 0.1.9

### Patch Changes

- 4456fd7: Document the full `AuthState` shape returned by `getAuthState()`/`setAuthState()` (`errorName`, `retriable`, and the `confirmingSignIn` state) in the auth READMEs, and note that `bb-auth-cognito` / `bb-auth-oidc` consumers import the type from `@aws-blocks/auth-common`.
- fac0e75: fix(auth-common): Enter submits the Authenticator form from any field, not just the last
  
  The rendered auth form isn't a native `<form>`, so submit-on-Enter is wired
  explicitly — but the handler was bound only to the *last* visible input. In any
  multi-field form, pressing Enter in an earlier field did nothing: the username in
  a username+password sign-in, or the verification code in a code+newPassword
  confirm-reset form. Enter now submits from every visible field, matching native
  form behavior.

## 0.1.8

### Patch Changes

- 5eee114: Add npm keywords for discoverability via `npm search keywords:aws-blocks`
  
  Every published package now carries an npm `keywords` array: the shared `aws-blocks`
  discovery tag plus 2–5 functional keywords describing the package's domain and the
  AWS services it uses (e.g. `realtime`, `websocket`, `pubsub` for `bb-realtime`;
  `ci-cd`, `pipelines`, `deployment` for `pipeline`). Metadata only — no runtime,
  API, or behavior change.

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- 75f5446: Add optional `fallback` parameter to `AuthenticatedContent` for rendering alternative content when the user is not authenticated.
- 2ed4177: Add stable `data-testid` hooks to the auth UI components so e2e suites can target the shipped `Authenticator` instead of forking it. Covers every interactive element (field inputs, hidden ones included, and submit buttons) plus the containers worth asserting against: the root, per-action wrappers, heading, error, the signed-in marker, `AuthenticatedContent`, and `AccountMenuBar`. Presentational markup such as hint text and layout wrappers stays unhooked. The full selector contract, including the `<action>:<provider>` form federated actions produce, is documented in CUSTOMIZING-AUTH-UI.md.

  The `@aws-blocks/blocks` umbrella package receives a `patch` because it re-exports these components from `@aws-blocks/auth-common/ui`. Sibling patch releases stay inside the umbrella's caret ranges, so `changeset version` never bumps it on its own (#212), and it is republished explicitly to stay in step with the components it hands to consumers.

- 58f77dd: Document four things people were reverse-engineering from compiled output.

  - **Runtime config resolution.** The client config is served at the dotted path `/.blocks-sandbox/config.json`; `/config.json` is not a route, so a 404 there means nothing. `{"_placeholder":true}` in the frontend build output is the Hosting construct's synth-time stub (the real `apiUrl` is still an unresolved CloudFormation token), so it is expected pre-deploy rather than a broken config. Covers the resolution order, what each environment should actually return, and what a genuine failure looks like.
  - **`RawRoute`.** Full section in the core README: constructor signature, a `GET` example that sets status, `Content-Type` and body, what you can read off `ctx.request` and write to `ctx.response`, path/parameter/wildcard syntax, and the registration rules (reserved paths, duplicate routes, register-during-load). Also added a "serve a raw HTTP endpoint" entry to the block catalog decision tree, which had no pointer to it.
  - **Server-initiated OIDC sign-in.** New section in the `bb-auth-oidc` README for `GET /aws-blocks/auth/signin/<provider>`: the redirect chain through the IdP and the callback, the pending-auth and session cookies, the JSON error shape, a runnable `curl` walkthrough, when to use it instead of the client PKCE API, and a pointer to the integration tests that assert each response. One route is mounted per configured provider, so an undeclared provider name 404s instead of reporting `ProviderNotConfiguredException`, which comes from `getSignInUrl()`.
  - **Error and RPC semantics.** `ApiError`'s constructor arguments (including `cause` staying server-side and `retriable`), how its `status` becomes the JSON-RPC error code and decodes back into an `ApiError` on the client, `hasAuthError`'s signature and when it applies instead of `isBlocksError`, how `params` is read as positional args vs a named object, that a top-level JSON array body (a batch) is rejected with `-32600`, and that `broadcastAuthChange` comes from `@aws-blocks/blocks/ui` rather than the package root.

  Docs only, plus tests locking in the documented `ApiError`, `params` and batch-rejection behaviour, and the documented `404`s on the OIDC sign-in and sign-out routes.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- 1da34f1: fix(auth): propagate the structured error name through `setAuthState()`

  The recommended client auth path is `createApi()` → `setAuthState()`. When an
  action failed, `setAuthState()` caught the thrown `ApiError` and returned an
  `AuthState` carrying only `error: e.message`, discarding the structured
  `e.name` (e.g. `'InvalidCredentialsException'`). Because `AuthState` had no
  field for an error name, a hand-rolled client could not branch on error type
  (e.g. "try sign-in, fall back to sign-up for a brand-new user") without
  brittle string-matching the human-facing message.

  `AuthState` now carries an optional `errorName`, and the `bb-auth-basic` and
  `bb-auth-cognito` `setAuthState` implementations populate it from the thrown
  `ApiError.name` (skipping the generic `'ApiError'` default). A new
  `hasAuthError(state, name)` type guard in `@aws-blocks/core` lets clients
  branch on the returned state — `isBlocksError` only matches thrown `Error`
  instances, so it cannot be used on the plain `AuthState` object. Rule of
  thumb: throw path → `isBlocksError`; returned `AuthState` → `hasAuthError`.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- ba3bf7b: docs: add per-package DESIGN.md documents

  Adds a `DESIGN.md` to each building-block package describing its architecture, API surface, mock implementation, and key design decisions.

  - Each document is cross-checked against the current source so identifiers, environment variables, error names, and described behavior match the implementation.
  - Each `DESIGN.md` is listed in its package's `files` array so it ships on npm alongside `README.md`.
  - For consistency, `bb-auth-cognito`'s document lives at the package root like every other package.
  - Bumps the umbrella `@aws-blocks/blocks` package so its bundled `docs/` — assembled from these block READMEs at build time — republishes with a fresh version. Its packed content changes whenever the READMEs change, but the version was previously left untouched, which tripped the publish integrity guard.

- d4a1390: Fix `onAuthChange` and `Authenticator` to paint a synchronous first frame.

  Both previously deferred their initial emit/render behind the async
  `ensureState().then(...)`, so a signed-out UI never painted synchronously on
  subscribe — leaving a blank first frame and causing non-deterministic timeouts
  in CI harnesses (and contradicting `onAuthChange`'s documented "calls callback
  immediately" contract). `onAuthChange` now emits the last-known user from the
  shared cache synchronously, then refreshes from the async hydration — with a
  dedupe to avoid a spurious `null → user` flash and a `.catch` so a rejected
  `getAuthState()` never strands the UI. `Authenticator` does the same synchronous
  first paint from the cache and gains the same `.catch` hardening.
