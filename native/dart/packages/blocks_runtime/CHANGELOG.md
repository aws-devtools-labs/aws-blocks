## Unreleased

- `BlocksClient` now POSTs a call to `{baseUrl}/{namespace}` (for example
  `…/aws-blocks/api/reports` for `reports.build`) instead of the shared
  `/aws-blocks/api`, the same path the TypeScript client uses, so a namespace
  that runs on its own compute is served by that compute. The JSON-RPC body is
  unchanged. Deploy the backend with `@aws-blocks/core` 0.8.0 or later before
  shipping an app built with this version: an older backend serves only
  `/aws-blocks/api` and rejects the per-namespace path.
- Add `validateTransferableDescriptor`, which checks a descriptor's `__blocks`
  tag against the tag the spec declared and returns it.
- Add `UnknownTransferable`, returned for a direct method result whose
  transferable tag has no known runtime binding, instead of untyped `dynamic`.
